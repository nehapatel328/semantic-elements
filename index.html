        <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
        <p><q>Semantic elements</q> are HTML5 elements that define types of content that compose a web page, both to the website browser and developer. In other words, a semantic element will define the function of a line of text within a webpage. For example, if you want a form, you would use the element &lt;form&gt;	, which gives a clear command. In the past, vague elements, such as &lt;span&gt;	, were used in conjunction with IDâ€™s and classes. However, a semantic element can be clearly recognized by the browser and any developer. When properly organized, semantic elements can work together to intuitively structure the information hierarch of a webpage. You can begin with a &lt;header&gt;	 element that will let the browser, developer, and even reader know what the content of the page will be about to the actual &lt;article&gt;	 with the content and end with a &lt;footer&gt;	 that has relevant copyright information. </p>
